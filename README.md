# BRADY GERBER: Frontend, Accessibility, Music & Writing ðŸ‘‹

## Iâ€™m a writer who codes: a full-stack software engineer (JavaScript, React, Python) and music journalist (New York Magazine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone). In everything I do, in the arts, tech, or the combination of both, I strive for clarity and to turn information into storytelling. Let's build something.

- ðŸ”­ Recently launched: [A digital newspaper sharing the best music news and longform writing built with Python, Flask, and Beautiful Soup](https://github.com/bg-write/candyfloss-flask)
- ðŸŒ± Currently building: a new music blogging platform built with TypeScript, Gatsby, and Contentful (repo coming soon)
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking for: Other software engineers who work in music (what are y'all listening to?)
- âš¡ What's grabbing my attention: Creative (and silly!) ways to make the lo-fi Internet more accessible
