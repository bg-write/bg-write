### Iâ€™m a writer who codes - a software engineer and music journalist. In everything I do, in the arts, tech, or the combination of both, I strive for clarity and accessibility, to turn information into storytelling. Let's build something.

- ðŸ”­ Recently launched: [A digital daily newspaper sharing the best music news and longform writing built with Python, Flask, and Beautiful Soup]([https://github.com/bg-write/how-i-got-my-first-dev-job](https://github.com/bg-write/candyfloss-flask))
- ðŸŒ± Currently building: a new music blogging platform built with TypeScript, Gatsby, and Contentful (repo coming soon)
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking for: Other software engineers who work in music (what are y'all listening to?)
- âš¡ What's grabbing my attention: Creative (and silly!) ways to make the lo-fi Internet more accessible
