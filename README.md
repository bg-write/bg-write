## New York Magazine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone * JavaScript, Python, React

### Iâ€™m a music journalist and software engineer whoâ€™s been writing and coding for 10+ years. I love to build things. In everything I do â€“ in the arts, tech, or a combination of both â€“ I strive for clarity and accessibility, and turn information and facts into storytelling.

- ðŸ”­ Just launched: [Big D'oh: Homer Reads 'Cracking the Coding Interview'](https://github.com/bg-write/big-doh)
- ðŸŒ± Currently building: A new music-related Python project (repo coming soon).
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking for: Other software engineers who work in music or media, or with music tech. (What are y'all listening to?)
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goal: Contribute to at least 2 new open-source projects. (Need any fresh eyes on your project?)
- âš¡ What's grabbing my attention: The art and science of making the Internet more accessible.
