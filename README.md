### Iâ€™m a music journalist and software engineer. I love to build things. In everything I do â€“ in the arts, tech, or a combination of both â€“ I strive for clarity and accessibility, and to turn information and facts into storytelling.

- ðŸ”­ Just launched: [A new Spotify web player (with lyrics!)](https://github.com/bg-write/spotify-clone)
- ðŸŒ± Currently building: An upgrade to your favorite cal app (repo coming soon).
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking for: Other software engineers who work in music. (What are y'all listening to?)
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goal: Contribute to at least 2 new open-source projects. (Need any fresh eyes on your project?) UPDATE: Goal completed! Still seeking to contribute to more open-source projects.
- âš¡ What's grabbing my attention: Creative (and silly!) ways we're making the Internet more accessible.
