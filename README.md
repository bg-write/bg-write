## New York Magazine, Pitchfork, Rolling Stone * JavaScript, Python, React

### Iâ€™m a music journalist and software engineer whoâ€™s been writing and coding for 10+ years. I love to build things. In everything I do â€“ in the arts, tech, or a combination of both â€“ I strive for clarity and accessibility. Simple is not the enemy.

- ðŸ”­ Just launched: [What Time Should I Write?](https://github.com/bg-write/what-time-should-i-write)
- ðŸŒ± Currently building: [Big D'oh: Homer Reads 'Cracking the Coding Interview'](https://github.com/bg-write/big-doh)
- ðŸ‘¯ Looking for: Other software engineers who work in the music industry or with music tech. (What are y'all listening to?)
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goal: Contribute to at least 2 new open-source projects. (Need any fresh eyes on your project?)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've yet to beat LeBron James in 1-on-1 basketball. (One day ...)
